    <h4><strong>The Problem</strong></h4>
    <p>Unequal distribution of wealth, justice, safety, stability, and opportunity in Chicago. Unresolved racial tensions and segregation from past and present discriminatory practices. We still have a lot of healing to do.</p>
    <h4><strong>The Underlying Cause</strong></h4>
    <p>In a city as densely populated as Chicago, we have somehow managed to create a false sense of distance and separation from one another.
    “If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.”
    <em>- Mother Theresa</em></p>
    <h4><strong>The Solution</strong></h4>
    <p>We restore a sense of human connection through storytelling, peace circles, relationship building. We cross boundaries and barriers, talking to people who seem dissimilar to us. A CONNECTED CHICAGO offer a chance for reconciliation to those who have been harmed by institutional systems.</p>
