    <h5 class="white">Art can be a collective microphone for you to be heard. Posting art on our website, and tagging your neighborhood to specific artwork, whether it be songs, graphic design, murals, photography, drawings, etc. allows Chicago to dialogue – both within and across neighborhoods. Each neighborhood will have the opportunity to be heard. The website will function as a “Living Document/Artwork” gathering testimonies, personal truths, artistic expressions and qualitative evidence of a need and desire for a Connected Chicago.</h5>
