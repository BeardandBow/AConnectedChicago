    <h5 class="white">A CONNECTED CHICAGO is a movement that aims to foster empathy through storytelling. The online storytelling component of the campaign is not a substitute for real-life engagement or proximity with persons, but merely a supplement or launching point for engaging these, at times uncomfortable, stories. By clicking and listening to the stories below, you too can foster empathy and learn what is needed to Connect Chicago by going to the source - our fellow Chicagoans.</h5>
